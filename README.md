This is a GUI to make .cbz archives from folders, .cbz files, and .zip files.

It's named volumize since the only usage is probably to compile individual manga chapters into volumes. Since I read manga on a Kobo this makes life easier.

## Usage

1. Clone the project, and create a virtualenv inside.
2. Running `pip install .` should install PyQt5 which is the only dependency.
3. The app can be started with `python -m volumize`
